Hello developers!
These pages are aimed at students who want to get involved with Apache Brooklyn and wants to contribute a new feature by submitting a project to GSoC

We heartily welome contributions and new members.
There's nothing official needed to get involved; 
simply come say hello somewhere in the [community](../community/index.html):

Then pick a GSoC marked task in [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BROOKLYN) and volunteer to work on it.
